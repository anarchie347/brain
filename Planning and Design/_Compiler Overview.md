# Brain Compiler Overview

In order to compile high level Brain code into brainfuck, the code will be translated through *many* intermediate language. In this file is a list of the intermediate languages in order from lowest level (brainfuck) to the highest level (brain). This list will continually change, expand and shrink as i work things out. Design and development will begin from the lowest level language and eventually work up to Brain.
See individual files for details about each intermediate language
