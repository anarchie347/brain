# Brain

Brain is a strongly typed procedural high level language with syntax inspired by C#, JS and rust

The main feature of brain is that it compiles to [brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck). Because of this, Brain code is slow and ineffecient, and Brain is not intended for everyday practical use.

This repositors currently doesnt have any code as I am still designing how i can implement this compiler. It is an extension of/replacement to my [very outdated gist on brain](https://gist.github.com/anarchie347/b0907775acf2f9036ebb8a4f4e016046). This repository contains more up to date plans and ideas
